# Quantitative Projects

This repository serves as a central hub for my **quantitative research and data analysis projects**, bringing together multiple individual projects and simulations in one place. Each subfolder contains a separate project with its own README and detailed code.  

**Current Subprojects Include:**  
- **JPMC Quantitative Research Job Simulation:** Completed the virtual internship on Forage, covering **time series forecasting, energy contract valuation, credit risk modeling, and FICO score bucketing**. [Detailed project here](./Quantitative_Projects/tree/main/quant%20jpmc%20job%20sim)  
- *Other projects will be added here as they are completed.*

**Tools & Skills:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SARIMA, data visualization, financial modeling, credit risk analysis.

**Purpose of this Repo:**  
To demonstrate hands-on experience in **quantitative modeling, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision-making** across multiple domains including energy markets and finance.
