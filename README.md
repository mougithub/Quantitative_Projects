# Quantitative-Research-JP-Morgan-Job-Simulation-Virtual-internship
I recently completed the JPMC Quantitative Research job simulation in Forage. Here is what I learned in details and in simple terms.
There were 4 main tasks in total:

Task 1 - Take historic existing price data (monthly snapshot) and extarpolate for next year price estimation. Visualize and find patterns for the factors that caused the variation. 
What I did: 

Task 2 - price a commodity storage contract used VSCode and "Nat_Gas.xlsx"

Task 3 - credit risk analysis used Jupyter Notebook (much easier) and "task 3 and task 4_Loan_Data.csv"

Task 4 - bucket fico scores used Jupyter Notebook and "task 3 and task 4_Loan_Data.csv" somewhat confused on this task, however, tried to finish
