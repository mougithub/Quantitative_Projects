# Quantitative-Research-JP-Morgan-Job-Simulation-Virtual-internship
I recently completed the JPMC Quantitative Research job simulation in Forage. Here is what I learned in details and in simple terms.
Tools used: 
The job simulation can be divided into **two main** projects with **4 tasks** in total, detailed promts are in each project folder.
In first project(Task 1 and Task 2) I was given a natural gas price data and told to 

**Task 1** - Take historic existing price data (monthly snapshot) and extarpolate for next year price estimation. Visualize and find patterns or seasonal trends for the factors that caused the variation. 

**What I did**: 

**Task 2** - Build a pricing model so they can buy gas in summer to store and sell in winter in order to take advantage of the resulting increase in gas prices. There are a lot of parameters that should be taken into account for pricing like injection/withdrawal cost, storage costs, the prices at which the commodity can be purchased/sold on those dates etc.

In second project(Task 3 and Task 4) I was given a loan data and told to

**Task 3** - credit risk analysis used Jupyter Notebook (much easier) and "task 3 and task 4_Loan_Data.csv"

**Task 4** - bucket fico scores used Jupyter Notebook and "task 3 and task 4_Loan_Data.csv" somewhat confused on this task, however, tried to finish
