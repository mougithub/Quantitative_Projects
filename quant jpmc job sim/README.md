I recently completed the **JPMC Quantitative Research Job Simulation** on Forage. Below is a brief overview of the projects and tasks I completed.  

**Tools used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  

The simulation consisted of **two projects with four tasks**:

---

### **Project 1: Natural Gas Price Analysis**
- **Task 1 – Time Series Forecasting**  
  Used historical monthly natural gas prices to identify trends and seasonality, then forecasted future prices using a **SARIMA model**. Visualized patterns and built a function to retrieve predicted or historical prices for any date.  

- **Task 2 – Storage Contract Valuation**  
  Developed a **pricing model** for gas storage contracts to optimize buying and selling based on forecasted prices. Considered injection/withdrawal rates, storage costs, and max volume constraints to calculate potential contract value.

### **Project 2: Credit Risk Analysis**
- **Task 3 – Probability of Default & Expected Loss**  
  Modeled credit risk using loan data. Trained **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** models, calibrated probabilities, and computed expected losses for individual borrowers.  

- **Task 4 – FICO Score Bucketing**  
  Bucketed FICO scores using a combination of **K-Means clustering and Decision Process**, estimated probability of default per bucket, and visualized the results.

**Summary:**  
This simulation strengthened my skills in **time series forecasting, financial modeling, supervised learning, risk assessment, and data visualization**, while giving hands-on experience in applying quantitative techniques to real world energy and finance problems.
